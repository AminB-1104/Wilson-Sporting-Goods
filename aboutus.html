        <div class="container-fluid text-center">
            <h2>A little History about our company</h2>
            <p>
                Wilson Sporting Goods, often simply referred to as Wilson, is a renowned American sports equipment
                manufacturer with a rich history that spans over a century. The company has played a pivotal role in
                shaping the sports industry and has become synonymous with quality and innovation in various sports.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wilson Sporting Goods was founded in 1913 by Thomas E. Wilson in Chicago, Illinois. The company
                initially focused on producing tennis racket strings, aiming to provide high-quality strings for tennis
                enthusiasts. Wilson's dedication to quality quickly earned it a reputation in the tennis community, and
                by the 1920s, they had expanded their product line to include tennis rackets.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the decades that followed, Wilson continued to innovate and expand into other sports. They introduced
                the first steel tennis racket in 1967, revolutionizing the game. Wilson's innovative approach to
                equipment design also extended to golf, as they developed popular golf clubs and balls.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of Wilson's most iconic products is the Wilson NFL football. Since 1941, Wilson has been the
                exclusive supplier of footballs to the National Football League (NFL). These footballs have been used in
                countless NFL games, including Super Bowls, solidifying Wilson's position as a trusted brand in American
                football.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to tennis and football, Wilson Sporting Goods has made significant contributions to sports
                like basketball, baseball, and golf. Their basketballs, used in various NBA championships, are a
                testament to their commitment to quality. Wilson baseballs have been used in Major League Baseball (MLB)
                for many years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wilson's commitment to innovation has also led to collaborations with athletes, resulting in signature
                equipment lines. Famous athletes like Serena Williams, Roger Federer, and Tom Hanks have endorsed Wilson
                products, further enhancing the company's reputation.
            </p>
            <p>

                            Occasionally a carrier will scan a package as delivered before it arrives at the final
                            destination. When this happens, the package is usually delivered within the next few
                            business days. If you've waited a couple of days and you still don't have the package:See if
                            someone else accepted delivery. Check with household members, neighbors, building managers,
                            the mail room, front desk, and anyone else who may have accepted the delivery.Look around
                            the delivery location. Carriers sometimes leave packages in a safe, hidden place like on a
                            side porch, in/around your garage, or behind bushes.Look for a notice of attempted delivery.
                            You may find an attempted delivery notice in your mailbox or on your door. Follow the
                            instructions on that notice to request redelivery or pick up the package.Contact the
                            carrier. Ask if they have additional information about the package's location. (Have your
                            tracking or delivery confirmation number handy.) If your package was shipped via UPS, they
                            may be able to hold the package at their local hub for you to pick up. You can call UPS and
                            see if this is possible.Most packages arrive by the estimated delivery date listed in the
                            tracking information. If you do not receive the package by then, please allow an additional
                            day or two for the package to be delivered. Please note that carriers may deliver packages
                            up until 8 p.m.
